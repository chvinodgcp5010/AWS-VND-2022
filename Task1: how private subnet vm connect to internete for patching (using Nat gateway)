CREATE 
========
1.Create VPC
myVPC  10.0.0.0/24

2.Create Subnet
subnet01-pub 10.0.0.0/25
subnet02-pvt 10.0.0.128/25

3.Create IGW
myIGW (attach myVPC to IGW)
                          
4.Create Route table (Here public subnet and pvt subnet is based only on route tables created)

Public-RT
Pvt-RT

click Public-RT -> subnet association add( subnet01-pub )
click on Route (Public-RT) add 0.0.0.0/0 with myIGW

5.Create vm in pub-subnet 
  other vm in pvt subnet 
  
===============================================================================================================================
Note:
Create 1 instance public subnet and other in prvt subnet.

both Vm's  manually enable public ip from aws console . Here only public subnet able to connect to internete and download updates.
but private subnet will not able to connect , because we have not enable "internet connection"

If you still want to connect to vm deployed on "private subnet" , first connect VM deployed on "public subnet" from there you can connect to "pvt subnet" 
vm ( It will communicate because these both are in same subnet (with in the n/w it will connect) and both are in same vpc so both in same n/w)

If you want to connect private subnet vm first connect Vm deployed on public subnet and then from here you can connect.

try to download any you will get some error, because we are able to connect vm but "pvt subnet vm" donot have internet connection added.

If you want to download some patching updates from vm deployed on "prvt subnet" add NAT gateway to it.


Try to access it vm configured on public subnet. It will connect from command line or putty without any issue 
Same connect VM configured on Pvt subnet . It will not connect even though added public ip ( becasue its not having internet connection) 

Note: If you are deploying vm on private subnet "there is useless to add public ip"
================================================================================================================================

6.Create Nat gateway (NAT Gw must be deploy on Public subnet)
myNATGW -> Subnet (subnet01-pub) -> Connectivity type (Public)

click on Pvt-RT -> subnet association add( subnet01-pvt )
click on Route (Pvt-RT) add 0.0.0.0/0 with myNATGW


1.Try to connect VM deployed on public subnet 
2.From here only we can connect to VM deployed on PVT subnet using "Pvt ip address" (Public ip will not able to access) -> here private ip of Public subnet vm
and private ip of private subnet vm both are in same n/w so they can communticate with private address.

After adding NAT gateway and update Route table of private you can connect private subnet vm from vm deployed on public subnet and able to download updates
from internet.


1. Connection to public subnet vm (using public ip)

C:\Users\Downloads>ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@3.232.129.123

[ec2-user@ip-10-0-0-6 ~]$ sudo su -
Last login: Thu Aug 18 11:49:43 UTC 2022 on pts/1


2. Connection to private subnet vm (using privateip)
[root@ip-10-0-0-6 ~]# ssh -i "key.pem" ec2-user@10.0.0.192              (Pvt ip address of vm deployed on Pvt subnet)


3. we are able to download updates from vm deployed on private subnet using "NAt gateway"

[root@ip-10-0-0-192 ~]# yum update
