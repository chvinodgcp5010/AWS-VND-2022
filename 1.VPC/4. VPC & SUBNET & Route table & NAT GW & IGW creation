HOW PRIVATE SUBNET VM CONNECT TO INTERNET AND PERFORM SOME PATCHING ACTION?
========================================================================
VPC-1
SUBNET -2
ROUTE TABLE - 2
IGW -1
NAT GW -1 

1.Create VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
2.Create 2 subnets in differernt zones pvt-Subnet(10.0.1.0/24) and pub-subnet (10.0.2.0/24)
3.Create 2 route tables with vpc -> name it as public-rt and private-rt 
add subnets to route table 
public-rt  ===>pub-subnet
private-rt ===>Private-subnet

4.Create IGW -> Attach IGW with VPC
5.Click on Route table -> Name : Public-rt
click on route and route dest (0.0.0.0/0) with target (IGW)

6.Create 2 VM's under vpc 1 in public subnet and other in private subnet
Public subnet vm:
================
ssh from public ip and try to install or ping to google.com
we can ssh and ping and install packages ( because for public subnet we have added "internet" to install or update packages.

Private Subnet VM:
===================
we dont have a "Public ip" to access over externl
-> so first connect "public subnet" vm having "publi ip" then from there connect to private ip 

->ssh to public ip 
->sudo su -
->Copy .pem key to the same path 
->connect with 
ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@10.0.1.247

-> you can ssh but not able to connect to internte (Ping google.com) because this subnet and rt is not having internet attached

7.Create NAT GATEWAY ( on public subnet)
Update "private-rt" 
0.0.0.0    nat-gateway 

and try to ping 

ping google.com
you can access to the private ip vm from private subnet to conenct to the internet using "NAT- gateway"

============================================= 1.CREATE VPC ==============================================

Region: us-east-1 (North virginia) 

VPC:
===
VPC Settings -> Resources to create 

VPC only
->Name: MY-VPC-VND

IPv4 CIDR blockInfo
->IPv4 CIDR manual input

IPv4 CIDR
->10.0.0.0/16

IPv6 CIDR block
->No IPv6 CIDR block

CREATE VPC

==================================== 2.CREATE SUBNET ==========================================

PRIVATE SUBNET:
===============

VPC ID: __________________ (Load your vpc id created earlier)


Subnet settings:
->Subnet name:        MY-VPC-Private-subnet
->Availability Zone:  Select any zone   (eg: us-east-1c)
->IPv4 CIDR block:    10.0.1.0/24         (In vpc 10.0.0.0/16 2 octets are blocked so need 10.0. are already blocked) it has 2 power 8 = 256 ip addresese.


PUBLIC SUBNET:
===============

VPC ID: __________________ (Load your vpc id created earlier)


Subnet settings:
->Subnet name:        MY-VPC-Public-subnet
->Availability Zone:  Select any zone   (eg: us-east-1a) -> Both subnets will be Same az or different az no issue.
->IPv4 CIDR block:    10.0.2.0/24         (In vpc 10.0.0.0/16 2 octets are blocked so need 10.0. are already blocked) it has 2 power 8 = 256 ip addresese.
                                          total available ip addresses will be 251

By default subnets will not allocate "Public ip address" to the VM 
-> We need to edit subnets created (only public subnets we need public ip) so need to enable it or at the time vm creation also we have 
a chance to enable it.

Auto-assign IP settingsInfo
Enable the auto-assign IP settings to automatically request a public IPv4 or IPv6 address for a new network interface in this subnet.

Click on "Public subnet" --> "Actions" --> "Edit Subnet settings"

Auto-assign IP settings
  -> Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address and save 

Note:
====

Only The vm's created on "public subnet" we need to "public ip" so we enabled Public ipv4 address to "Public subnet"
for private we do not requie "public ip"

           
==================================== 3.ROUTE TABLES ==========================================

Set of rules ,which are used to determine "where the n/w traffic has to be routed" 
->It specifies the destination subnet (called prefix) and gateway router to reach it.

Once we create Subnets , it will create 1 route table automatically, So keep it as it is and create 2 route tables 

Create route table:
===================

Name: MY-VPC-Private-rt
VPC:  (select vpc)

CREATE

Name: MY-VPC-Public-rt
VPC:  (select vpc)

CREATE


======== Add subnets to route table ===========

By default Once we create subnets , it will create automatically 1 Route table and those 2 will map to "Defult" Route table.

Click on Route table
->MY-VPC-Private-rt
  --> actions --> edit subnet associations 
    -->Click on Subnet (MY-VPC-Private-subnet)
      --> Click on Save association



Click on Route table
->MY-VPC-Public-rt
  --> actions --> edit subnet associations 
    -->Click on Subnet (MY-VPC-Public-subnet)
      --> Click on Save association

================== Add IGW to Public subnet =========================

First create IGW then click on Route table -> Click on "MY-VPC-Public-rt"
-> Click on "EDIT Routes"
-> Add route  Destination (0.0.0.0/0)  and Target (Internet gateway)  and click on save changes



============================== 4. INTERNET GATEWAY ======================

IGW is a VPC component that helps "instances to communicate over the internet" using "targets" provided in "route table"

-> The instnace that need to have internet access "must have a global ip and relevant security groups"
-> Route table of subnet in which the instance is present must point to "IGW"

Route table which we have added "public subnet" must point to IGW to access over internet

->PUBLIC SUBNET:
  ->Subnet which is attached with IGW is called "Public subnet"


CREATE IGW:
-----------
Name: MY-VPC-IGW

Click on "Create Internet Gateway"

By default once we create IGW , the state will be "Detached" -> need to attach this to "VPC"

Actions ->Attach to VPC -> Select vpc ->Click on attach to IGW

Once attach IGW with VPC you will get the status of IGW in AWS CONSOLE is 

MY-VPC-IGW     igw-0953f5f1171c5d9d0	 Attached	vpc-02a07e6563ed15f6d | MY-VPC-VND


=============================== CREATE Secuirty group ============================

Be default secuirty groups "Allow all oubtbound" traffic and block "Inbound traffic"

1.CREATE SECUIRTY GROUPS :

EC2-->Security group 

Security group name: MY-VPC-sg
Description        : allow ssh
VPC                : (add vpc)

Inbound rules :
 --> add rule
   --> Type (SSH)  -->Source -->Custom --> 0.0.0.0 

Outbound rules :
Type (all traffic)   -->Destination -->Custom (0.0.0.0/0)

Click on"Create Secuirty group"


================== CHECK THE USAGE OF OUTBOUND RULES =====================

Inbound rules --> enabled SSH to Login
Outbound rules --> 

From vm we need to connect internet AND install packages So we need to enable outbound connection to update and install packages.


====== Remove outbound rules and check install or update packages ======

->remove outbound rules and try update or install pkgs

You will receive error (because we have outbound connection) allowed only ssh inbound to login to the vm.

$ping google.com

================================ CREATE 2 VM's ===================================

1.Vm-1 in private subnet ( no public ip)
2.Vm-2 in public subnet ( have public ip )

CONNECT TO PUBLIC VM
=====================

Connect to VM-2 and SSH in to it ( opened inbound in security group SSH so we can logint)
Install packages  any (yum install httpd -y) ( we can downalod because we have enbled outbound all traffic)

VM-2 ->Public subnet ->(attach to) Public-rt ->(attach to) IGW 


CONNECT TO PRIVATE VM
=====================
Opend cmd where .pem file present and execute with 

->ssh -i "aws.pem" ec2-user@10.0.1.247
ssh: connect to host 10.0.1.247 port 22: Connection timed out

It will not connect why?
-> becuase we can connect to outside using "PUBLIC IP" only . then HOW TO CONNECT?

1.First connect to public ip 
2.From public ip enabled vm connect to "Private ip" of vm instance

Subnet group 
-> inbound rules --> SSH 22 must be enabled
-> outbound rules --> must be enabled ( here all traffic 0.0.0.0/0) enabled


Connect to Publicly added vm

->ssh -i "aws.pem" ec2-user@3.228.219.247
->[ec2-user@ip-10-0-2-222 ~]$ sudo su -

Create *.pem file and COPY the key aws.pem to the path 
vi key.pem            (use any name)


Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.
chmod 400 key.pem

======================= WHAT IS THE NEED OF PRIAVATE SUBNET VM TO CONNECT TO INTERNTET? ========================

->ping google.com
PING google.com (172.253.115.100) 56(84) bytes of data.

Priavate instance to connect to google (it will not exchange any packets) because it will not have any "GATEWAY" to connect to internet. which is what
the private instance tobe

1.Many of private instances inside "private subnet" need access to the internet 
-> because of "Updating database" 
-> Updating "security patches" etc

HOW TO DO THIS?

============================================= NAT GATEWAY ======================================

NAT GW -> Created so that private instance will connect to internet

-> 1 way access
->Nat device enable private subnet to access over internet or other aws resources and "Prevent internet from initiating connections 
to the instance" ( Mean vm can go to internet and install packages But on internet people will not connect and access to it)

->Private subnet connect to internete using "NAT Gateway" device 


Name         : My-VPC-Nat
Subnet       : (My-VPC-Public-subnet)              ==> NAT must install on Public subnet.
Connectivity type: Public
Allocate elastic ip: 

CREATE NAT GATEWAY


==================================== ADD NAT GATEWAY details over Private route table =====================

Click on "MY-VPC-Private-rt"
->Edit routes -> add route 
->destination (0.0.0.0/0)   target : NAT-gateway

Click on SAVE
