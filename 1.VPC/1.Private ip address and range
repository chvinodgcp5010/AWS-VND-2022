Private IP Addresses are those addresses that work within the local network.

These addresses are non-routable on the Internet. The address is basically assigned by the network router to your particular device. 
The unique private IP address is provided to every device which is on the same network. In this way, devices communicate with one another on the 
same network without connecting to the entire Internet.
