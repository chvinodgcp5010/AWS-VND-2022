IGW & NAT :
It logically enables routing of traffic in public network

DNS:
Map Domain Name to Ip address

Elastic ip:
Static ip which never changes (Supports only IPV4)

VPC Endpoints:
Private connection b/w your vpc and other aws services without using internet

Network interface:
A point of connection b/w public and pvt n/w

Egress only IG:
Allows only outbound communictation from EC2 over IPV6

Route tables:
Defines how traffic is routed b/w each subnet.

VPC peering:
Connection b/w vpc's


======================================
1.What are subnets?
Subnet is a subdivisio of larger n/w
Ip address with common prefix are in same subnet.
172.31.


========================= CREATING VPC WITH AWS CONSOLE ===============================

->Create Custom VPC

VPC Name    : VPC_DEMO
CIDR        : 10.0.0.0/16
Subnets     : 1 public and 1 pvt in separate az
INGW        : 1
Route table : 1 in public subnet
Secuirty groups: 2
Nat gateway : 1



========================================================================================
                  AZ1    (web servers) (10.0.0.5),-->NAT Gateway, -->Public  subnet(10.0.0.0/24)  ->Route table 10.0.0.0/16 local , 0.0.0.0 IGW-ID 

VPC

                          (DB Servers)(10.0.1.5) -->private subnet(10.0.1.0/24)   --> Route table 10.0.0.0/16(Destination) Local (target)
                                                                                      0.0.0.0    NAT_GW_ID


Here

Public Subnet:
->In rotute table added 0.0.0.0/0 as destication so it can connect to internete directly (webservers)
->have public ip address

Private subnet:
->Do not having public ip address
->(DB servers) we donot expose over public subnet but we need to access internet for any app installation or patching how it will connect?

Using NAT Gateway : Here we are connection to internet from DB servers over NAT gw.
Using this we can connect to internet and do patching work but outsiders will not access and perform any action.
